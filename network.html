      <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do I need to network even if I'm not job searching?</strong><br> Yes—building relationships early helps you access support, advice, and opportunities later.</li>
        <li><strong>What if I'm nervous about reaching out?</strong><br> Start small with classmates, faculty, and alumni. Using templates can help you feel more confident.</li>
        <li><strong>How often should I follow up?</strong><br> Send a thank-you note within 24-48 hours, and keep in touch periodically to maintain the connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Can AI tools really help?</strong><br> Yes—generative AI can suggest outreach messages or questions, but always review and personalize before sending.</li>
